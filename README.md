## [Finance-App-with-Streamlit](https://github.com/gurezende/Finance-App-with-Streamlit)

This project has two parts:
1. Performed a complete Data Analysis of a Financial tracking file and built a classification model with Logistic Regression. 
   The model predicts the probability of a given project to end the year within the approved budget. **The accuracy is 93%**.
2. The second part is a Web App created with Python and Streamlit where the user can upload a file with forecast inputs to get a couple of graphics with comparison between the projects and the average of the portfolio, as well as to find the predictions whether the projects uploaded will or will not meet the budget.

# | PROJECT 2
## [Wine_Quality_Predictions](https://github.com/gurezende/Wine_Quality_Predictions)
In this project, the idea was to simulate a business problem where a client (winery) had some data about their products and they wanted to see how the variables measured could possibly affect the wine quality, therefore, resulting in higher or lower grades for their wines. Then the client wanted to have their dataset divided in two clusters (white and red wines) and finally see some predictions about the quality for their new wines. It was all developed in R language, using R to build the app.
The work was divided in 3 main parts:
1. Exploring the data and creating some data visualizations, understanding the correlations between variables.
The result is on the first three tabs of the app: *Histograms, Boxplots and Report*.
2. Divide the dataset in two clusters. I have gathered both datasets (red + white) to simulate a request from the client where they needed to know which wine was what kind. The result was 98% accurate and that can be seen on the *Clustering* tab.
3. The final part was to create a Prediction Interactive Tool for the White Wines from the dataset that allows the client to input some values and have a prediction whether that wine is going to be qualified as High Quality (grades from 7-10) or Low Quality (grades from 3-6). You can interact with the tool in the tab *Predictions*. **The accuracy is 95%**.

# | PROJECT 3
## [Predicting Employee Turnover of a Business](https://github.com/gurezende/Predict-Turnover-Company)
This is a Project from the Data Scientist Program Degree by Data Science Academy Brazil. The idea is to build a classification model to predict if an employee will or not leave the company based on the variables satisfaction level, number of projects one is working, number of hours worked in a month and the years this person is in that company.

Activities performed:
* Data Exploration and Analysis
* Data Visualization (Histograms, Boxplots, Barplots)
* Correlation check
* Feature Engineering with Random Forest to select the best attributes for the model
* Classification: Training and Prediction with Random Forest **(99% accurate)** and XGBoost **(97% accurate)**
* (Creation of Random Forest and XGBoost with tidymodels)
* Creation of a Shiny App for user interaction and make predictions.

## [Bible Word Clouds](https://github.com/gurezende/Bible_WordClouds)
This project was created in R Language.
- Created a word cloud for each book in the Holy Bible.
  * Used for lops
  * Saved results in a PDF.

# | PROJECT 5
## [NYC-Airbnb](https://github.com/gurezende/NYC-Airbnb)
On this project, I was able to do a complete analysis with data exploration and visualization study on the *'New York City Airbnb Open Data'*.
- Created some plots to show the data and extract insights
  - Boxplots, histograms, bar graphics
  - Created a Map using Folium package with the locations of the places for rent and added HeatMap by price 
- Did a simple Natural Language Processing with nltk to analyze the reviews of the rentals.
  - Word Cloud, word frequence count, Bigrams and Trigrams analysis.
- Wrote a Conclusion Report.

# | PROJECT 6
## [Recommendation Systems](https://github.com/gurezende/Studying/tree/master/MIT/Module4)

In this project, I have created three different types of Recommendation Systems using Python and the **surprise** package.
* I have created a Popularity Based Recommender
* Created an Item-Based Recommender: Collaborative Filtering
* Created a Model-Based Recommender with SVD algorithm (matrix factorization).
